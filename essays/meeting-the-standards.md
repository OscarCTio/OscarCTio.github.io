When I first started coding, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that my code was a mess. I cared almost exclusively about whether the program worked, not whether anyone, including my future self, could easily read, understand, or maintain it. Indentation was sometimes inconsistent, variable names were vague, and documentation was mostly an afterthought. It wasn’t until my second programming class that I began to realize that writing “working code” is only part of what it means to be a good software engineer. How code is written matters just as much as what it does. I used to think coding standards were just about braces and spacing, but now I realize they actually help me think more clearly and write higher-quality code.

Sticking to a coding standard is important because it makes code easier to read, understand, and maintain, both for yourself and for others. When everyone follows the same rules for naming, formatting, and structure, the codebase becomes more consistent and predictable, which reduces confusion and mistakes. This consistency is especially important in team projects, where multiple people may work on the same files at different times. A clear coding standard also helps catch small issues early, before they turn into bigger bugs, and encourages better habits that lead to cleaner and more reliable software overall.

I have been working with VSCode and ESLint for a few days now. Since the syntax and conventions for each language are different, and because I just started learning TypeScript this semester, I am still figuring out how I should write and format my code. ESLint helps with this a lot by pointing out issues that I would not normally notice. While it can be sometimes a little frustrating to see warnings and errors, it has been useful in teaching me better habits and making me more aware of how small details in code structure can affect readability and quality.

Overall, my experience with coding standards and tools like ESLint has changed how I think about writing code. What once felt like unnecessary restrictions now feels like guidance that helps me write clearer, more consistent, and more maintainable programs. Even though following a strict standard can be frustrating at times, especially when learning a new language like TypeScript, I can already see how it pushes me to slow down and be more intentional about how I structure my code. In the long run, these habits will make me a better collaborator and a more disciplined programmer, which is just as important as being able to make a program work in the first place.
