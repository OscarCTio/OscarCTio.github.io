summary: "Designed a digital ALU that was deployed in Falstad Circuit Simulator."

The Digital ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) project is a digital design assignment where you build, simulate, and implement a 4-bit ALU that performs a set of eight arithmetic and logic operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, shifts, bitwise XOR, and comparison). First was to design individual operation circuits, then create a control unit that selects the correct operation, and finally implement and test the complete ALU design both in a circuit simulator and in Verilog.
